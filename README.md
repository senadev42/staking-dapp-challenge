Challenges Implemented

1. Update the interest mechanism in the Staker.sol contract so that you receive a "non-linear" amount of ETH based on the blocks between deposit and withdrawal
📘
I suggest implementing a basic exponential function!

2. Allow users to deposit any arbitrary amount of ETH into the smart contract, not just 0.5 ETH.

3. Instead of using the vanilla ExampleExternalContract contract, implement a function in Staker.sol that allows you to retrieve the ETH locked up in ExampleExternalContract and re-deposit it back into the Staker contract.
