Challenges Implemented

1. Update the interest mechanism in the Staker.sol contract so that you receive a "non-linear" amount of ETH based on the blocks between deposit and withdrawal

2. Allow users to deposit any arbitrary amount of ETH into the smart contract, not just 0.5 ETH.

3. Instead of using the vanilla ExampleExternalContract contract, implement a function in Staker.sol that allows you to retrieve the ETH locked up in ExampleExternalContract and re-deposit it back into the Staker contract.
